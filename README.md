## Software as a Service: Google Cloud Vision API using Java

#Application Url: https://gaeproject-276401.appspot.com/

#About Application:  application firstly asks user to upload an image on server. After uploading the image, Google Cloud Vision API is invoked for analysing the image to detect labels. And finally the results are returned in well formatted table containing detected labels of the image. Our application is basically divided into 3 parts: Frontend, GAE and Backend
State of application: Application is successfully implemented and is in fully working condition.


#Issues :
Intially met with little ambuguity of setting up the Google cloud Vision API but it was very soon resolved after working on it.
Encountered a problem getting the output for the image uploaded. Then tried resolving the base problem of it by giving the path of image in static way.
Later worked on the the actual working of application by adding the dynamic behavior to it.
